INSTALLATION

++++++++++++++++++++

NOTE
The sudo ./use_odoo did not work for me so the work around is install webmin 
and manually add transliterate from and to these paths

From
/home/bitnami/.local/lib/python3.11/site-packages
To
/opt/bitnami/odoo/venv/lib/python3.11/site-packages

	LINUX
	cd /opt/bitnami/
	sudo ./use_odoo
	pip install transliterate

Also let me know if any issues its installed on Odoo 17.0-20231105 (Community Edition) 

Still need to do more testing to confirm everything is working
